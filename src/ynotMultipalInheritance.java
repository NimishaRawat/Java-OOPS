/* java has a better way of defining things
 multiple inheritance face problem when there exist methods with some signature in both the super
 methods with same signature in both the super classes.
 Due to such problems, java does not support multiple inheritance directly
 but the similar concept can be acheived using interfaces.
 A class can implement multiple interfaces and xtend a class at the same time.
1. interfaces in java is a bit like class but with a singnificant diffrence
2. An Interface can only have method signatures , fileds and default methods
3 The class implementing an Interface needs to on declare the moethods(not nessasarly the field)
 fields - Variables
4. You can create a reference of interfaces but nit the object
5. Interface methods are public by default*/
/*Default Method - An interface*/
public class ynotMultipalInheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
