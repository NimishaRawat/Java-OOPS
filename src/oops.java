    // These are short and crisp notes related tom basic introduction of OOPs concept
    //object-oriented programming tries to map code instructions
    // with real world making thw code  short and easier to understand
    //solving the problem by creating objects is one of the most
    // popular approaches in programming.
    // DRY - do not repeat yourself
    // use methods to perform a repeating task don't write the
    // sam e code again and again
    //Class - A class is a blueprint for creating objects
    // Object - An Object is an instantiation of a class. When a
    // class is defined , a template(info) is defined. Memory is
    // allocated only after object instantiation.
    // how to model a problem  in OOPs
    // we identify the following :
    // Noun -> class -> Employee
    // Adjective -> Attributes -> name,age,salary
    // verb -> Methods -> getSalary(),increment()
    // Concepts
    // 1. Abstraction - Hiding internal details
    // 2. Encapsulation - the act of putting various components
    // together (in a capsule)
    // the sensitive data can be hidden from the user
    // 3. Inheritance - The act of deriving new things from
    // existing things (Implements DRY!)
    // 4.Polymorphism - One entity many forms
