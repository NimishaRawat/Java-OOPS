/*Errors & Exception in Java
* No matter how smart we are , errors are our constant
* companions. With practice , we keep getting better at
* finding 2 correcting them.
* There are three types of errors in java.
* 1. Syntax Errors
* When Compiler finds something wrong with our program,
* it throws a syntax error.
* 2. Logical Errors
* A logical error or a bug occurs when a program compilers and round but does
* the wrong thing.
* - Message delivered wrongly
* - Wrong time of chats being displayed
* - Incorrect redirects!
* 3. Runtime errors - also called Exceptions
*   Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running.
*   These are also called Exceptions!
*   These are encountered due to circumstances like bad input and (or) resource
*   constraints.
*   Ex : User supplies 'S' + 8 to a program that adds two numbers.
*   Syntax errors and logical errors are encountered by the programmers , whereas the
*   Run-time errors are encountered by the users.
*   Syntax errors and logical errors are encountered by the programmers , whereas
