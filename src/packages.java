/*java is a hybrid language -> both compiled as well as interpreted
 java file gets complied and produces a bytecode and that
 1. bytecode is being interpreted by interpreter
 2. A JVM can be used to interpret this bytecode
 3. This bytecode can be taken to any platform(windows/Mac/Linux)
 for execution
 4. Java is platform independent (write once runs everywhere)
 javac harry.java -> Compiled
 java harry.class -> Interpreted
 So fare the execution of program was being managed by intellij data
 We can download Vs code to compile and execute our Java programs
 Packages in Java
 A package is used to group related classes.Packages help in avoiding name
 conflicts. These are two types of packages:
 1 Builtin packages -> Java API
 2. User defined packages -> Custom packages
  Ways to use Java packages
  1. import java.lang -> import everything form java.lang
  2. import hava.lang.String -> import String from java.lang
  3. new java.lang.String("Harry") -> use without importing
